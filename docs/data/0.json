You can try with following solutions:\n1. Make sure you install nodejs and the dependency packages correctly. You can use the following command to check your installation:\n    ```bash\n    cd voyager/env/mineflayer\n    node index.js\n    ```\n   If you see `Server started on port {PORT}`, then your installation is correct. You can kill the process by `Ctrl+C`.\n2. Make sure you install Fabric correctly. You should be able to select the Fabric version in the Minecraft launcher. \n3. Each Mineflayer process can only listen to one port. If you want to start multiple instances of `Voyager`, you need to manually change the port when initialization:\n    ```python\n    from voyager import Voyager\n    voyager = Voyager(\n        server_port=3001, # default is 3000\n        ...\n    )\n    ```\n## I saw the bot left and rejoin the game after each task.",

However, if you wish to avoid the reset, you can use `voyager.learn(reset_env=False)` and consider increasing the `env_wait_ticks` value. This will provide Mineflayer with additional time to sync with the Minecraft game.\n## How to show the bot's first-person view?\nDue to the Mineflayer's limitation, we currently can not directly get the bot's view in the game.

Moreover, GPT-3.5 has a limited context length, which means it may provide incomplete responses. If you insist on using GPT-3.5, it is essential to configure it with `skill_manager_retrieval_top_k` ≤ 2 to reduce the context length of the prompt.\n## What's the estimated cost of running Voyager?\nUsing Voyager for approximately 160 iterations using GPT-4 will cost you around 50 USD. It's important to keep a close eye on your OpenAI API expenses and avoid unnecessary spending. Once Voyager begins running, it's recommended to monitor the bot's behavior for a period and ensure that it successfully completes some tasks.",

Sometimes GPT-4 will write an infinite loop that runs forever. In this case, there'll be a request timeout. Using Azure login can automatically resume the running if there's a request timeout.\n## Option 1: Microsoft Azure Login (Recommended)\nUsing this method will allow Voyager to automatically resume when there's a request timeout. This is dependent on the [minecraft-launcher-lib](https://minecraft-launcher-lib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/microsoft_login.html#let-the-user-log-in) library.\n1. Sign in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).\n2. Go to [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\n3.
