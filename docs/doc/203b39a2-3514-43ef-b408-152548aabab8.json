Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place."

For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided. Do not propose task starting with these keywords.\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.\nTask: The next task.\nHere's an example response:\nReasoning: The inventory is empty now, chop down a tree to get some wood.\nTask: Obtain a wood log."
