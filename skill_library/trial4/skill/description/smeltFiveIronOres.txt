async function smeltFiveIronOres(bot) {
    // The function is about smelting 5 raw iron ores into iron ingots using a furnace and coal as fuel. It first checks if the bot has a furnace in its inventory, and crafts one if not. Then it finds a suitable position to place the furnace and places it there. If the bot doesn't have enough coal, it mines enough coal to smelt 5 iron ores. Finally, it smelts the 5 raw iron ores into iron ingots using the furnace and coal as fuel.
