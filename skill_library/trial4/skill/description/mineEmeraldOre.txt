async function mineEmeraldOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining a single emerald ore block using an iron pickaxe. First, the function equips the iron pickaxe. Next, it explores the environment until finding an emerald ore block. Once an emerald ore block is found, it mines the block using the iron pickaxe. If the emerald ore block is not found within the exploration time, it sends a message indicating that the block was not found.
