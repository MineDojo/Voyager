    // The function is about mining 3 spruce logs. It first searches for a nearby spruce log block, and if none are found, it explores the environment until it finds one. Once a spruce log block is found, it mines a total of 3 spruce logs using the `mineBlock` function. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that the spruce logs have been mined.
