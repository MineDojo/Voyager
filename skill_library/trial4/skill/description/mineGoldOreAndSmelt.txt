async function mineGoldOreAndSmelt(bot) {
    // The function is about mining a single gold ore block and smelting it into a gold ingot using a furnace. First, it checks if the bot has an iron or diamond pickaxe in its inventory, and if not, it crafts an iron pickaxe. Then, it explores in a random direction until it finds a gold ore block. Once found, it mines the gold ore block and places a furnace nearby if it doesn't exist. Finally, it smelts the gold ore block into a gold ingot using coal as fuel.
