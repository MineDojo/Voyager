async function craftShieldWithIron(bot) {
    // The function crafts a shield using 6 spruce planks and 1 iron ingot. It checks if there are enough spruce planks and iron ingots in the inventory, and if not, it mines and smelts the required materials. It also places a furnace and a crafting table if they are not already placed. Finally, it crafts the shield and logs a message in the chat.
