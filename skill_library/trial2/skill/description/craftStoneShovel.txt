    // The function crafts a stone shovel using cobblestones and sticks. It checks if there are enough cobblestones and sticks in the inventory, and if not, it mines cobblestones or crafts sticks. If there is no crafting table nearby, it places one. Finally, it crafts a stone shovel and logs a message.
