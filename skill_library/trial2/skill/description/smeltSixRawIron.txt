async function smeltSixRawIron(bot) {
    // The function is about smelting 6 raw iron using a furnace and coal. It first checks if a furnace is in the inventory, and if not, it returns a message to craft one. It then places the furnace next to the player and checks if there is enough coal in the inventory. If there isn't, it mines coal until there are 6 pieces. Finally, it smelts 6 raw iron using the furnace and coal, and returns a message indicating that the process is complete.
