async function mineFiveIronOres(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 5 iron ores using either a stone or iron pickaxe. If neither pickaxe is found in the inventory, the bot will mine cobblestone and craft a stone pickaxe. Once a pickaxe is available, the bot will equip it and explore the environment until finding an iron ore block. Once an iron ore block is found, the bot will mine a total of 5 iron ores using the equipped pickaxe.
