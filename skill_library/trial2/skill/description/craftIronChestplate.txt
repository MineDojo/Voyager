async function craftIronChestplate(bot) {
    // The function crafts an iron chestplate using iron ingots. If there are not enough iron ingots in the inventory, the bot will mine iron ores and smelt them into iron ingots. Then, the bot will search for a nearby crafting table and place one if it is not found. Finally, the bot will craft an iron chestplate and chat a message indicating that the item has been crafted.
