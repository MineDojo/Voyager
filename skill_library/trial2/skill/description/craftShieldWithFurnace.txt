async function craftShieldWithFurnace(bot) {
    // The function crafts a shield using a furnace and a crafting table. It checks if there are enough iron ingots and spruce planks in the inventory, and if not, it smelts iron ingots and crafts spruce planks. If a furnace or a crafting table is not nearby, it places one. Finally, it crafts a shield using the crafting table and logs a message.
