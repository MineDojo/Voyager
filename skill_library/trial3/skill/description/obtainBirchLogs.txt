    // The function is about obtaining 5 birch logs. It checks if there are enough birch logs in the inventory and mines the required number of birch logs if necessary. Once 5 birch logs are obtained, it sends a chat message. If there are already 5 birch logs in the inventory, it sends a different chat message.
