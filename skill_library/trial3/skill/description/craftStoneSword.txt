async function craftStoneSword(bot) {
    // The function crafts a stone sword using cobblestones and sticks. It first checks if there are enough cobblestones and sticks in the inventory. If there are not enough cobblestones, it returns. If there are not enough sticks, it crafts more using oak planks. Then, it places a crafting table near the player and crafts a stone sword using the crafting table. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that the stone sword has been crafted.
