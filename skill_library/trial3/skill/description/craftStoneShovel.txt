async function craftStoneShovel(bot) {
    // The function crafts a stone shovel using cobblestones and sticks. It first checks if there are enough cobblestones and sticks in the inventory. If there are not enough sticks, it crafts more using oak planks. Then, it places a crafting table near the player and uses it to craft a stone shovel. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that the stone shovel has been crafted.
